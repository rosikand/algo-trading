## Alpaca Paper Trading

This is a directory where I store some files regarding paper trading through [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/). 

Note: if you would like to use this code for your account, you will need to specify your own account variables to connect your account to the API. See the Alpaca documentation for more information. My variables used in this directory have been saved to another file that is not private. 

More specifically, you should make a separate `.py` file and specifiy the following constants through declaring variables:

- `API_KEY` 
- `SECRET_KEY`
- And the `BASE_URL` which is = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"
